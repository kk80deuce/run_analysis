There were 560 different measurements taken from each subject while they were doing 6 different activities.
We removed all the columns that didn't include a mean or standard deviation measurement, which left 85 collumns.
Then we took the mean of each subject for each activity and put that in a tidy data set, which is called final_table.txt
